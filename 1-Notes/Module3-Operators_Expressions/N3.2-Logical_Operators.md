### 🧠 What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in decision-making statements like `if`, `while`, etc.

Python provides three logical operators:

| Operator | Meaning                          | Result                                     |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `and`    | True if **both** are True        | `True and True → True`, else `False`       |
| `or`     | True if **at least one** is True | `False or True → True`                     |
| `not`    | Negates the condition            | `not True → False`, `not False → True`     |

They are commonly used to write complex conditions more clearly.

## 🧪 2. Syntax

```python
# Logical AND
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code runs only if both are True

# Logical OR
if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code runs if at least one is True

# Logical NOT
if not condition:
    # Code runs if condition is False

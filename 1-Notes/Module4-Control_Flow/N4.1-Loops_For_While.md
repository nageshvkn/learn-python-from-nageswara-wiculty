# 🌀 `while` and `for` Loops in Python

---
## 📘 Overview:

- Loops are fundamental in programming. They allow us to repeat actions efficiently.
- Python provides two primary loop constructs: `while` and `for`.
- This chapter explores both in depth, with examples, exercises, and mini projects.

> #### Trainer Note: 
> - Write code repeatedly without `for` loop
> - Use for loop and repeatedly execute the code

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the syntax and usage of `while` and `for` loops.
- Learn the differences between entry-controlled (`while`) and sequence-based (`for`) loops.
- Apply loops to automate repetitive tasks in code.
- Identify and fix common mistakes while working with loops.
- Design and implement real-world logic using loops.

## 🔁 The `for` Loop
A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range.

---

### Syntax-1: range(start)
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4
```

---

### Syntax-2: range(start, stop)
Syntax:
```python
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)  # Prints 2 to 6
```

---

### Syntax-3: range(start, stop. step)
```python
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)  # Prints 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
```

---

> ### 🎯 Remember:
> **range(start, stop, step)**:
> - start: where to begin (inclusive)
> - stop: where to stop (exclusive)
> - step: increment/decrement

---

### Syntax-4: Loop over a String
```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

---

### Syntax 5: `Nested Loop` (Multiplication Table)
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()
```

---

### Syntax 6: `for` Loop with `List`
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
    print("Hello", name)
```

---

### Example 7: `for` Loop with `break`
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break # Stops the loop immediately.
    print(i)
# Real-time Scenario: Exit loop early on error or condition.
```

---

### Example 8: `for` Loop with `continue`
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2: 
        continue # Skips the current iteration.
    print(i)
# Real-time Scenario: Skipping unavailable products in a list.
```

---

### Example 9: # `for` loop with `else`
Executes `else:` code block if the loop completes without break.
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished without break.")

# Real-time Scenario: Loop all orders, then mark task as completed if no failures
```

---

### Example 10: # Looping over `files` in a directory
```python
# Looping over files in a directory (with os module)
import os
for filename in os.listdir("/path/to/folder"):
    print(filename)
```
---

### Example 11: List Comprehension (loop in `one line`)
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
# Real-time Scenario: Data transformation before visualization.
```

---

> ==========================================================

---

### 🔁 What is a while Loop?
A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1 
    # Don't forget to update the loop variable, (i).
    # Otherwise, loop will become infinite.
```

**Key Points:**
- The condition is checked before entering the loop.
- Make sure the loop progresses towards the termination condition to avoid infinite loops.


## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1: while Loop to Print Even Numbers
```python
n = 2
while n <= 10:
    print(n)
    n += 2
```

## 🧠 Differences Between while and for Loops

| Feature           | `while` Loop                                | `for` Loop                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Use Case**       | When the number of iterations is unknown     | When iterating over a sequence              |
| **Condition Check**| Before each iteration                        | Implicit via sequence                       |
| **Risk**           | Infinite loop if condition never becomes false | Less prone to infinite loops               |
| **Control**        | Manual incrementing                          | Automatic via sequence or `range()`         |

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting to update loop variables in a `while` loop.
- ❌ Using `range()` incorrectly (off-by-one errors).
- ❌ Modifying the iterable inside a `for` loop.
- ❌ Infinite loops without exit condition in `while`.

## 🏋️ Exercises

### 1. Print numbers from 1 to 20 using `while` and `for`.
### 2. Sum all numbers in a list using `for`.
### 3. Write a loop to count the number of vowels in a string.
### 4. Print the reverse of a given string using a loop.
### 5. Use a `while` loop to ask user input until "exit" is entered.

## 💡 Mini Project: Prime Number Finder

### 📝 Description
Take input from the user and print all prime numbers up to that number.

### 🧑‍💻 Code
```python
# 📘 Prime Number Finder

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# 🎯 Input
limit = int(input("Enter upper limit to find prime numbers: "))

print("Prime numbers up to", limit, "are:")

# 🔁 Loop through numbers
for num in range(2, limit + 1):
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num, end=" ")
```

### 🎓 Concepts Used
- `for` loop
- User input
- Function definition
- Conditional statements
- Type casting
- Comments and docstring

---

## 📚 Real-World Applications
- Data processing loops (files, logs, API data)
- Repeating UI prompts
- Simulation programs
- Calculations in finance, physics, etc.

---

## 🧼 Best Practices
- Use `for` when the number of iterations is known.
- Use `while` for input-based or condition-based logic.
- Avoid deeply nested loops when possible (can reduce performance).
- Add proper comments to clarify loop logic.

🧠 Think Deeper Prompts
Why might you choose a while loop over a for loop?
What are the risks of using while True?
How does range(start, stop, step) enhance loop control?
Can you simulate a for loop using a while loop?

---

🔗 Best Practices
✅ Use for loops when iterating over known sequences.
✅ Use while loops for condition-based repetition.
✅ Always ensure loop termination.
✅ Use break and continue judiciously.
✅ Add comments for clarity in complex loops.

## Infinite Loop Consequences
🔥 Resource Consumption
- CPU usage spikes: The loop runs as fast as possible, consuming cycles
- Memory leaks: If the loop creates objects or opens files without cleanup
- Disk I/O overload: If it writes to files or logs continuously
- Network strain: If it sends requests or listens without throttling

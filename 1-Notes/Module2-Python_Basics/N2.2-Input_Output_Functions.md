# 🔤 Input/Output Functions

---

# 🎯 Learning Objectives
- ##### Understand how to take input from users in Python.
- Learn how to display output to the screen.
- Explore `print()` and `input()` functions in detail.
- Format output using f-strings and other methods.
- Practice with examples, exercises, and build a mini project.

---

## 📘 1. What are Input/Output Functions? 

Input/Output (I/O) functions in Python allow programs to interact with users or external systems by receiving input and displaying output.

- **Input**: Accepts data from the user via the console.
- **Output**: Displays data to the screen or other output devices.

These functions are essential for building interactive programs.

## 🧮 2. The `print()` Function

The `print()` function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).

### ✅ Syntax:
```python
print(value1, value2, ..., sep=' ', end='\n')
```

- `sep`: Separator between multiple values (default is a space).
- `end`: What to print at the end (default is newline).

#### 🧪 Example-1
```python
print("Hello, world!")                      # Simple output
print("Python", "is", "awesome")            # Multiple values
print("A", "B", "C", sep="-")               # Custom separator
print("Line1", end=" ")                     
print("Line2")                              # Custom end
```

#### 🧪 Example-2
Custom Separator and End

```python
print("Python", "is", "awesome", sep=" 🔹 ", end="!\n")
```
---

## 🧮 3. The `input()` Function

The `input()` function is used to take user input as a string.

### ✅ Syntax:
```python
input("Prompt message:")
```

#### 🧪 Example-1
Taking input from the user
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```
> ### 🧠 Remember..!
> - The input() function always returns data as a string.
> - You can convert it to other types using casting functions like int(), float(), etc. for arithmetic operations.

#### 🧪 Example-2
Numeric Input and Calculation

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You will be", age + 1, "next year.")
```

```python
length = float(input("Enter length: "))
width = float(input("Enter width: "))
area = length * width
print("Area of rectangle:", area)
```
---

## 🧠 4. String Formatting in Output

You can format your output to look cleaner using:

### 1. f-strings (Recommended in Python 3.6+)
```python
name = "Ravi"
score = 85
print(f"{name} scored {score} marks.")
```

### 2. `.format()` method
```python
print("{} scored {} marks.".format(name, score))
```

### 3. % formatting (Old style)
```python
print("%s scored %d marks." % (name, score))
```
---

### 🧠 Summary

- `print()` is used for displaying output. Customize with `sep` and `end`.
- `input()` gets data from users as a string.
- Convert input with `int()`, `float()` for calculations.
- Use f-strings for clean and readable output.
- Practice with interactive programs like quizzes, calculators, etc.

## 💡 Think Deeper

1. Why does input() always return a string? What are the implications for data validation?

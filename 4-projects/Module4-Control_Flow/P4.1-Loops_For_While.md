### âœ… Solution:
```python
"""
ðŸ“˜ Program to accept marks of 5 students and print average marks
"""

total = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    marks = float(input(f"Enter marks for student {i}: "))

## ðŸ§© Mini Project-2: Word Frequency Counter

### ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement
Count how many times each word occurs in a sentence

### ðŸŽ¯ Requirements
> ðŸ“Œ Concepts Used: for loop, string split, list/set, word count.

---

### âœ… Solution:
```python
"""
ðŸ“˜ Count how many times each word occurs in a sentence
"""

# Input sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Convert to list of words
words = sentence.split()

# Unique words
unique_words = list(set(words))

# Count using for loop
for word in unique_words:
    count = words.count(word)
    print(f"{word}: {count} times")
```

### âœ… Solution:
```python
"""
ðŸ“˜ Mask each character in a password except the first and last character
"""

# Input
password = input("Enter your password: ")

# Masking
masked = ""

for i in range(len(password)):
    if i == 0 or i == len(password) - 1:
        masked += password[i]
    else:
        masked += "*"

print(f"Masked Password: {masked}")
```
